his dataset was constructed by adding elevation information to a 2D road network in North Jutland, Denmark (covering a region of 185 x 135 km^2). Elevation values where extracted from a publicly available massive Laser Scan Point Cloud for Denmark (available at : [Web Link] (Bottom-most dataset)). This 3D road network was eventually used for benchmarking various fuel and CO2 estimation algorithms. This dataset can be used by any applications that require to know very
accurate elevation information of a road network to perform more accurate routing for eco-routing, cyclist routes etc. For the data mining and machine learning community, this dataset can be used as 'ground-truth' validation in spatial mining techniques and satellite image processing. It has no class labels, but can be used in unsupervised learning and regression to guess some missing elevation information for some points on the road.
